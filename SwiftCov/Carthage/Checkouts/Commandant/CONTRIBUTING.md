We love that you’re interested in contributing!

Please file issues or submit pull requests for anything you’d like to see! We just have a couple of guidelines to make things easier for everyone involved.

## Prefer pull requests

If you know exactly how to implement the feature being suggested or fix the bug being reported, please open a pull request instead of an issue. Pull requests are easier than patches or inline code blocks for discussing and merging the changes.

If you can’t make the change yourself, please open an issue after making sure that one isn’t already logged.

## Code style

If you’re interested in contributing code, please have a look at our [style guide](https://github.com/github/swift-style-guide), which we try to match fairly closely.

If you have a case that is not covered in the style guide, simply do your best to match the style of the surrounding code.

**Thanks for contributing! :boom::camel:**
